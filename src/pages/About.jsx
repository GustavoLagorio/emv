            I am Ezequiel Vieta, a passionate photographer and videographer
            dedicated to visual storytelling.
            <br></br>I am a digital nomad, I travel depending on each project,
            and that's why I'm willing to go to any corner to capture unique
            moments.
            <br></br>
            What I am to bring to the creative industry is my unique perspective
            and the style with which I capture these moments. For me,
            storytelling is essential in everything I do, and I always strive to
            present it in the most natural way possible.
            <br></br>I believe that the moments that happen between the
            highlighted instances are what truly matter. To me, it's about
            comprehending the complete picture and valuing the journey as a
            whole. Through my projects, I strive to tell stories that transcend
            the obvious and delve into the essence of each experience.
            <br></br>
